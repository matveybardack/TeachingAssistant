**Purpose**: To validate that the requirements for the ticket generation algorithm in the specification are clear, complete, and testable.

### Requirement Clarity & Specificity

- [ ] CHK001 - Is the input for the "target complexity" clearly defined as a user-provided `double`? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the "percentage tolerance" requirement specified with a clear data type (e.g., `int`)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 - Does the spec explicitly state that the calculated type ratio must be simplified to its smallest integer form (e.g., 4:2 becomes 2:1)? [Clarity, Spec §GR-C.1]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the definition of ticket "uniqueness" (set of IDs, order irrelevant) unambiguously defined? [Clarity, Spec §GR-D.1]

### Scenario & Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK005 - Does the spec define the algorithm's behavior if the input `tasks.txt` is empty? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are requirements defined for a scenario where no combination of tasks can satisfy the complexity rule (GR-A.1)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are requirements specified for a scenario where no combination can satisfy the thematic rule (GR-B.1)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK008 - Does the spec cover the case where there are not enough tasks of a certain type to ever meet the calculated ratio (GR-C.1)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the behavior defined for when all possible unique tickets have been generated, but more tasks are available? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK010 - Does the spec explicitly require that the randomization (GR-E.1) still ensures that no rule is violated? [Consistency]

### Acceptance Criteria & Measurability

- [ ] CHK011 - Can the "maximum possible number of tickets" (SC-001) be objectively determined for a given input, or is it subject to randomness? [Measurability]
- [ ] CHK012 - Is the requirement for providing a "clear, correct message" upon stoppage (SC-003) specific enough to be testable? [Clarity]
